# Testi strategy
> ISTQB: A high-level description of the levels of testing to be performed and the testing included in these levels for an organization or program from one or more projects.

A test strategy is a high-level static document, usually developed by a project manager. This is a document that reflects the approach to product testing and achieving goals, and gives a clear idea of what the testing team will do for the entire project. It is usually derived from the Business Requirements Specification (BRS). As soon as the testing strategy is ready, the testing team begins to write a detailed test plan and continues further testing steps. In the Agile world, some companies don't take the time to prepare a test plan because of the minimum time for each release, but they maintain a test strategy document. This is one of the important documents in test deliverables that the testing team shares with stakeholders to better understand the scope of the project, risks, testing approaches, and other important aspects.

The content of the strategy will vary depending on the project, so there is no one-size-fits-all template. You can find heuristics to help, a lot of foreign articles on the topic of strategy development and some common points that are more often used:
- Scope and overview: the scope of testing work (what to test and why to test) and an overview of the product under test;
- Test Approach:
- Test levels;
- Test Types;
- Roles and responsibilities;
- Environment requirements;
- Testing tools: tools necessary for conducting tests (TMS, bug tracking system, automation stack);
- Industry standards to follow: this section describes the industry standard for producing a high-quality system that meets or exceeds customer expectations. Usually, the project manager defines the testing models and procedures that must be followed to achieve the project goals;
- Test deliverables: documentation to be created before, during, and after testing;
- Testing metrics: metrics that should be used in the project to analyze the status of the project;
- Requirements Tracking Matrix (RTM);
- Risk and mitigation: all the risks of testing and a plan to reduce them;
- Reporting tool: how will defects and problems be tracked;
- Test Summary: types of summary reports on the tests that will be created, indicating the frequency. Summary test reports will be generated daily, weekly or monthly, depending on the criticality of the project.
