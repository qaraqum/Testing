# Levels of testing
![Pyramid](https://jab.ru/levels.jpeg)

## Unit tests
- Focus on individual units of code like functions and classes
- Major chunk of test cases
- Requires programming knowledge
- Lightweight tests that can run independently

## Integration tests	
- Focus on integrations between different systems
- These tests may have some dependencies on other modules and systems and hence are not as lightweight as unit tests

## End-to-end tests	
- Testing is done from the customer’s perspective rather than a developer’s
- UI-based testing hence takes longer to run
- Fewer in number compared to unit and integration tests
