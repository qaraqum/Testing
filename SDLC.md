## Types of SDLC models
### Waterfall Model	
- Suitable for stable projects with clear requirements
- Sequential approach
- Documentation at every stage, hence easy tracking
- No flexibility for accommodating changing requirements or feedback
- The customer needs to wait till the final stage to review the product

### Spiral Model	
- Suitable for clear and complete requirements, but with room for future enhancements
- The iterative nature allows for continuous improvement based on feedback
- Focus on risk assessment and mitigation
- Effective risk assessment and management are required for project success
- Can be costly and resource intensive
- Difficulty maintaining and tracking stages of this model

### RAD Model	
- Suitable for projects with clear but presently incomplete requirements
- Components developed can be reused easily
- Small cycles may not give substantial functionalities to the product leading to significant delays in timelines
- Experts are needed to build products in this model

### Prototype Model	
- Prototypes help in identifying missing features or functionalities in the product in advance
- Since the customer is involved from the initial stages, there is no ambiguity
- Involvement of customer early on means that if the prototype is not satisfactory, the process goes on in a loop till success. This can prove to be time-consuming, effort-intensive, and costly

### Agile Model	
- Product is broken down into smaller cycles leading to the development of a working product quickly
- Easy to add new features
- Customer feedback is utilized at every stage
- Requires skilled resources to work in such an environment
- If the customer is unsure of the requirements then the project will be impacted
