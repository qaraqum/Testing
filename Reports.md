# Reports
> ISTQB: A document summarizing testing activities and results. It also contains an evaluation of the corresponding test items against exit criteria.

## Types of reports
A report is a document containing information about the actions performed and the results of the work performed. It usually includes tables, graphs, lists, simply describing information in the form of text. Their proportion and content determine the usefulness and clarity of the report.
It is important for us to understand for whom, for what and under what conditions we are doing this and how much it will improve the perception of the information we present. It must be remembered that every action has a specific purpose. In the case of a report, it is important for us to understand for whom, for what, and under what conditions we are doing this.
The most well-known versions of reports in testing are listed below.

### Incident report
A document describing an event that occurred, for example, during testing, and that needs to be investigated (IEEE 829).
An incident report can be defined as a written description of an incident observed during testing. To better understand, let's start with what an "incident" is. A software testing incident can be defined as an observed change or deviation in the behavior of the system from the expected one. This may be a deviation from a functional requirement or from the settings of the environment. Very often an incident is called a defect or error, but this is not always the case. An incident is basically any unexpected behavior or reaction of the software that requires investigation.
The incident needs to be investigated, and based on the investigation, the incident can be converted into a defect. Most often it turns out to be a defect, but sometimes it can happen due to various factors, for example:
- The human factor;
- The requirement is missing or unclear;
- An environmental problem, such as a lack of response from the internal server, causing periodic unexpected behavior or error. Or an incorrect configuration of the environment;
- Erroneous test data;
- Incorrect expected result.

Incident report is designed to record and report the incident to interested parties and conduct an investigation. It is compiled in a similar way to a bug report, possibly with an emphasis on investigation, discussion, impact, and may not be assigned to developers to clarify details.

### Test result report
A periodic report that documents detailed information about the test performance and its result. It also contains the conditions, assumptions, limitations of the test, which element of the test is being tested by whom. In addition, detailed information about the remaining work is entered to show how much more work needs to be done in the project.

### Test Execution Report
Contains the details of the execution and the result of the test execution. It is usually prepared to be sent to higher management from the test team to show the status of the test and the progress of the test. When we deliver the software to the customer, we will briefly send the complete information about the test execution. This will give the client a better understanding of the completed test and coverage.

### Test progress report
A document summarizing the tasks and results, compiled at certain intervals in order to compare the progress of testing with the basic version (for example, with the initial test plan) and notify about the risks and alternatives that require management's decision. (ISTQB)

### Analytical report on testing (test evaluation report)
A document created at the end of the testing process and summarizing the test activities and results. It also contains an assessment of the testing process and the experience gained. (ISTQB)

### The final test report (test summary report)
A document summarizing the tasks and results of testing, also containing an assessment of the relevant test objects relative to the exit criteria. (IEEE 829)
The summary test report contains detailed information about the testing conducted throughout the software development lifecycle. The elements in the final test report vary from organization to organization, and also vary for different projects. The information in the test report is based on the audience of the test report. The audience can be a client, management, business analyst, developers, test team members, organization members, etc.

### User acceptance test report
Is created during and after the UAT. It specifies the details of the acceptance test performed by the user and the result of the user acceptance test. It also lists defects that were not taken into account during UAT.
