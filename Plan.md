# Test plan
> IEEE 829: a document describing the goals, approaches, resources, and schedule of planned test activities. It defines the test objects, the properties for testing, the tasks responsible for the tasks, the degree of independence of each tester, the test environment, the test design method, determines the entry and exit criteria used and the reasons for their choice, as well as any risks that require contingency planning.

While the strategy outlines general principles or theory, the plan details the practical aspects of how the project will be tested in reality.
Although there are guidelines for writing a test plan, there is no single correct template or format for writing test plans. In the review articles, you can also find your own options:
- Test activities,
- Test logistics,
- Resources,
- Your support network,
- Estimates,
- Dependencies, Risks and Assumptions,
- Communication, Commitment and Progress Reporting
or:
- What resources are required and when;
- When tasks need to be started and completed, and who will perform them;
- Skills required to complete tasks;
- Tools and technologies supporting the plan;
- The results and when they will be delivered;
- The cost of effort and necessary resources;
- The process of promoting the project/process by stages;
- Risks that threaten delivery.
  
At some point, you may notice that they all offer a similar structure and points, plus or minus, and the final version will still be unique for each specific project. A significant part of the literature on this topic involves working on a waterfall development model and this information is not so relevant nowadays. This does not mean that there are no test plans in flexible methodologies. Even in Agile, pre-planning is necessary to structure work, allocate resources, and plan - at least at a high level -the release process for the coming months. But iteration after iteration, and often day after day, the overall plan is constantly being adjusted to take into account events and new information that comes to light. Planning is continuous learning, not a task with an end result.

In flexible methodologies, they are increasingly talking about the concept of a one-page test plan, and if necessary, additions and clarifications are simply created links to external pages/documents. Such a plan can be in Google tables, in the form of a dashboard, mind map, and as you please. The test plan is designed to answer the questions for which it is created. Sometimes a significant part of the benefits of this activity can be obtained at the stage of planning and drawing up a plan itself, and not from the document itself. If the team understands that this document does not solve any practical “pain” and its creation, there is no time for it, then you can perfectly do without formalizing it, because in some verbal form it will always exist anyway.

## Types of test plans
### Master test plan
> ISTQB: a test plan that usually covers several levels of testing.
This can be either the only basic plan, or the main one in the hierarchy of several plans, the most static and high-level. It is needed when:
- the product has many releases or iterations, between which general information is preserved, which makes no sense to repeat;
- different test teams are working on the same product, performing various tasks that need to be combined within a single document.

### Phase test plan
> ISTQB: a test plan that usually refers to one level of testing.

It is drawn up for each release/iteration or for each team within the project and is dynamic, i.e. it can undergo changes as necessary. Its main purpose is to briefly and clearly reflect the tasks of testing. There may be several detailed plans for individual software modules or test teams. In addition, plans can be created for individual levels of testing (Level Test Plan) or types of testing. Agile projects may have iterative testing plans for each iteration.

# Acceptance test plan
It is distinguished from a conventional test plan by the factors that lead to a business decision. The acceptance test plan is one of the vital documents that provides guidance on performing acceptance testing for a specific project. It is written based on Business Requirements. The review of this plan is usually performed by Managers/Business Analysts/Customers.
